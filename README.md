# THOR PC Computer (Compatible with Sinclair Ql)
A reverse engineering exercice using the Sinclair QL compatible Thor-20 Computer as target

## WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT IS NOT TESTED AND MISSING THINGS
This is not a functional item, it's only a exercice of reverse engineering to reinforce my skills in Kicad EDA Software.

## History

With the end of the compercial life of the Sinclair QL, other companies fill the gap, CST made create several models of the Thor computer.

The subject of this project is a interesting one, using old stock of original QL boards, and a re-edition of several of the previous expansion board together with a fancy desktop case to make a enhaced QL Computer, so the Thor consist of:

- The Original QL Board
- The RAM + ROM expansion board board (512Kb of RAM)
- The CST Floppy Disk Interface with 1 or 2 3 1/2" floppy drivers
- The CST SCSI Disk Interface
- The mICE mouse + desktop software solution
- A RTC implementation
- A fancy box
- A upgraded in-box power supply
- Standar PC XT Interface

This was called Thor PC, Thor 1 or Thor 8, depend of the sources of information, there are 3 version available, 1F, 2F, 2WF depend on the number of floppys and Winchister hard disc or not.

Later, CST upgrade it and made the Thor 20 and Thor 21, this was Thor 1 with a CPU-Addon card, that include a 68020 CPU at 12 or 16Mhz, and a 68881 FPU math coprocesor.

Unfortunately, the use of the original QL board, and the RAM in 8bits, cause this board to be only twice the speed of the original QL, while a Gold Card provide the same with twice the ram, and the Super Gold Card provide 4 times the speed of the QL, 4Mb of RAM using the same microprocessor.

## The Project

I will try to recreate all the hardware, and document in a proper way everything I can get of the Thor Computer, up to day there is only some low resolution pictures, a bad scanned service manual, and a dump of some of the ROMs of the computer.
